## **What I Learned In Week 0 at Code Immersives**

**Bash**

Description:

A command processor that where the user can type commands that cause actions in the computer.  Bash is almost a behind the scenes look at how the computer runs and can be used apart from the normal computer interface.

Some of the things that I learned about Bash:
* How to start it up


* How to navigate directories
    * It is very important to always know where your at and the appropriate path
    * This is typically done through the `cd` command
* How to see the contents of the directory and the actual directory
    * `ls`: Lists the files 
        * `-a`: A flag that also includes hidden files
    * `pwd`: Shows your current working directory

* How to create, remove, move, and copy files and directories
    * `mkdir`: Creates directories
    * `touch`: Creates files
    * `rm`: Removes files or directories
    * `mv`: Moves files or directories to chosen location
    * `cp`: Copies files or directories to chosen location
